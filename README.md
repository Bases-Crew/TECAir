## General Objective

The general objective of this project is to develop a system that enables the efficient management of TECAir's airline operations, catering not only to students but also to a wider customer base.

## Specific Objectives

1. Apply the concepts of the conceptual and relational model.
2. Create a PostgreSQL database to store data efficiently.
3. Develop an API service to centralize functionality.
4. Build two web pages for administrative and customer use.
5. Create a mobile application using SQL Lite as an embedded database.
6. Utilize tools such as Angular/React, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS, Entity Framework (to generate entity models from the database model), and Reporting Services (e.g., Crystal Reports) for report generation and PDF creation.
7. Prepare an installation document.
8. Develop a project plan that demonstrates teamwork and adherence to project guidelines.

## Problem Description

Your team has been tasked with developing a system to manage the administration of TECAir, a low-cost airline operating in Costa Rica. TECAir was established through negotiations between Costa Rica's leading public university and regional commercial airlines. Its primary goal is to provide students with an affordable option for international travel to pursue their studies abroad. While the target audience is students, TECAir aims to offer the same convenience and services as commercial airlines to a broader customer base.

Please refer to the "Requerimientos de Software" section for detailed software requirements. It is important to note that any delays in project delivery will result in a $20,000 monthly penalty for each week of delay.
